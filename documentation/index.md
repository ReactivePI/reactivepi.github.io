There's two ways in which you can use this library. First there's the core library, which contains all the driver communication needed to talk to the various IO ports on your Raspberry PI. Use this if you need basic access to the IO ports.

When you want to work in a more reactive way you can add the actors library to your application. This library provides actors for talking to the IO ports on your raspberry. Use this if you don't need low level access to the IO ports

## Samples
Want to see how you can work with the GPIO and I2C in practice. I'm still working on a few samples. Check the site for posts demonstrating the various ways in which you can use the
library.
