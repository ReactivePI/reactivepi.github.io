ReactivePI website
------------------
This is the website for the ReactivePI library.

## How to build
Install ruby on your local machine and install the jekyll
gem using the following command:

``` bash
gem install jekyll
```

For mac and linux users I recommend that you use rvm instead
of the regular ruby installation. Saved me a lot of trouble :-)
