description: An easier way to control your raspberry PI
---

A while ago I helped a colleague with a presentation about
his project to automate Lego trains using a Raspberry PI.
I didn't want to look bad on stage, so I had to learn to program the device myself.

What I saw was an environment in which developers were forced to build either
Python or C to control their device. The result: A very weird mix of scripts, small
programs and general mayhem to get something big like a Lego train running.

This is not ideal, as a developer you should not be forced to download a bunch
of python scripts, copy-pasting code that you cannot possible maintain.

With ReactivePI I want to offer you an easy to use API to control various hardware
components on your RaspberryPI.

It will be limited in the beginning, but I'm hoping you and others will help me
expand the possibilities of this library with more options to control your
Raspberry PI.
